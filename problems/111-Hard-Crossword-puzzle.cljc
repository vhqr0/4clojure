;; Write a function that takes a string and a partially-filled crossword puzzle board, and determines if the input string
;; can be legally placed onto the board. </br></br> The crossword puzzle board consists of a collection of partially-filled
;; rows. Empty spaces are denoted with an underscore (_), unusable spaces are denoted with a hash symbol (#), and pre-
;; filled spaces have a character in place; the whitespace characters are for legibility and should be ignored. </br></br>
;; For a word to be legally placed on the board: </br> - It may use empty spaces (underscores) </br> - It may use but must
;; not conflict with any pre-filled characters. </br> - It must not use any unusable spaces (hashes). </br> - There must be
;; no empty spaces (underscores) or extra characters before or after the word (the word may be bound by unusable spaces
;; though). </br> - Characters are not case-sensitive. </br> - Words may be placed vertically (proceeding top-down only),
;; or horizontally (proceeding left-right only).
