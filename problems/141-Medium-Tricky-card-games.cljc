;; <p> In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick-taking_game">trick-taking card games</a> such as bridge, spades, or
;; hearts, cards are played in groups known as "tricks" - each player plays a single card, in order; the first player is
;; said to "lead" to the trick. After all players have played, one card is said to have "won" the trick. How the winner is
;; determined will vary by game, but generally the winner is the highest card played <i>in the suit that was led</i>.
;; Sometimes (again varying by game), a particular suit will be designated "trump", meaning that its cards are more
;; powerful than any others: if there is a trump suit, and any trumps are played, then the highest trump wins regardless of
;; what was led. </p> <p> Your goal is to devise a function that can determine which of a number of cards has won a trick.
;; You should accept a trump suit, and return a function <code>winner</code>. Winner will be called on a sequence of cards,
;; and should return the one which wins the trick. Cards will be represented in the format returned by <a
;; href="/problem/128/">Problem 128, Recognize Playing Cards</a>: a hash-map of <code>:suit</code> and a numeric
;; <code>:rank</code>. Cards with a larger rank are stronger. </p>
