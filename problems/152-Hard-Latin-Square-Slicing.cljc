;; <p> A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square">Latin square</a> of order <code>n</code> is an <code>n x
;; n</code> array that contains <code>n</code> different elements, each occurring exactly once in each row, and exactly
;; once in each column. For example, among the following arrays <i>only the first one</i> forms a Latin square: <pre> A B C
;; A B C A B C B C A B C A B D A C A B C A C C A B </pre> </p> <p> Let <code>V</code> be a vector of such
;; vectors<sup>1</sup> that they may differ in length<sup>2</sup>. We will say that an arrangement of vectors of
;; <code>V</code> in consecutive rows is an <em>alignment (of vectors) of</em> <code>V</code> if the following conditions
;; are satisfied: <ul> <li>All vectors of <code>V</code> are used.</li> <li>Each row contains just one vector.</li> <li>The
;; order of <code>V</code> is preserved.</li> <li>All vectors of maximal length are horizontally aligned each other.</li>
;; <li>If a vector is not of maximal length then all its elements are aligned with elements of some <a
;; href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/subvec">subvector</a> of a vector of maximal length.</li> </ul>
;; Let <code>L</code> denote a Latin square of order 2 or greater. We will say that <code>L</code> <em>is included</em> in
;; <code>V</code> or that <code>V</code> <em>includes</em> <code>L</code> iff there exists an alignment of <code>V</code>
;; such that contains a subsquare that is equal to <code>L</code>. </p> <p> For example, if <code>V</code> equals <code>[[1
;; 2 3][2 3 1 2 1][3 1 2]]</code> then there are nine alignments of <code>V</code> (brackets omitted): <pre> 1 2 3 1 2 3 1
;; 2 3 1 2 3 A 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 B 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 1 2 3 1
;; 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 C 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 </pre> Alignment <b>A1</b> contains Latin
;; square <code>[[1 2 3][2 3 1][3 1 2]]</code>, alignments <b>A2, A3, B1, B2, B3</b> contain no Latin squares, and
;; alignments <b>C1, C2, C3</b> contain <code>[[2 1][1 2]]</code>. Thus in this case <code>V</code> includes one Latin
;; square of order 3 and one of order 2 which is included three times. </p> <p> Our aim is to implement a function which
;; accepts a vector of vectors <code>V</code> as an argument, and returns a map which keys and values are integers. Each
;; key should be the order of a Latin square included in <code>V</code>, and its value a count of <i>different</i> Latin
;; squares of that order included in <code>V</code>. If <code>V</code> does not include any Latin squares an empty map
;; should be returned. In the previous example the correct output of such a function is {3 1, 2 1} and <i>not</i> {3 1, 2
;; 3}. </p> <p> <sup>1</sup> Of course, we can consider sequences instead of vectors. <br /> <sup>2</sup> Length of a
;; vector is the number of elements in the vector. </p>
