;; The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">game of life</a> is a cellular automaton devised by
;; mathematician John Conway. <br/><br/>The 'board' consists of both live (#) and dead ( ) cells. Each cell interacts with
;; its eight neighbours (horizontal, vertical, diagonal), and its next state is dependent on the following
;; rules:<br/><br/>1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.<br/>2) Any
;; live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.<br/>3) Any live cell with more than three
;; live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.<br/>4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live
;; cell, as if by reproduction.<br/><br/>Write a function that accepts a board, and returns a board representing the next
;; generation of cells.
