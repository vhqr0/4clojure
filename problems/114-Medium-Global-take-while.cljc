;; <p><a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/take-while">take-while</a> is great for filtering
;; sequences, but it limited: you can only examine a single item of the sequence at a time. What if you need to keep track
;; of some state as you go over the sequence?</p> <p>Write a function which accepts an integer <code>n</code>, a predicate
;; <code>p</code>, and a sequence. It should return a lazy sequence of items in the list up to, but not including, the
;; <code>n</code>th item that satisfies the predicate.</p>
