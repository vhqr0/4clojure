;; A mad scientist with tenure has created an experiment tracking mice in a maze. Several mazes have been randomly
;; generated, and you've been tasked with writing a program to determine the mazes in which it's possible for the mouse to
;; reach the cheesy endpoint. Write a function which accepts a maze in the form of a collection of rows, each row is a
;; string where: <ul> <li>spaces represent areas where the mouse can walk freely</li> <li>hashes (#) represent walls where
;; the mouse can not walk</li> <li>M represents the mouse's starting point</li> <li>C represents the cheese which the mouse
;; must reach</li> </ul> The mouse is not allowed to travel diagonally in the maze (only up/down/left/right), nor can he
;; escape the edge of the maze. Your function must return true iff the maze is solvable by the mouse.
